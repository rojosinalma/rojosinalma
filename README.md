### Hello there üëã

I'm Fernando, but people also call me Fe√±a or Rojo (Red in Spanish).

‚úîÔ∏è **Some stuff about me:**
- I'm interested in DevOps, Platform Engineering, Cloud Architecture, self-hosted infrastructure, SRE, Security, and many other topics in tech.
- I code mostly in Ruby and Python (yay for interpreted langs), but I‚Äôm also proficient in Golang if that matters to you.
- I like orchestration through Kubernetes, but I also like to stay on the ground and maintain my own infra with simple tools.
- I have many hobbies like building PCs, playing Bass, electronics, tabletop games, D&D, videogames and a lot more... I try to put my adhd to work.

ü§ì **Some tech-related projects I enjoy:**
- Multimodal AI, RAG, GenAI and MCPs
- Building and using CLI tools, bots for different automations, system automation and other stuff that you can do without browsers.
- Backend applications, APIs, IoT and interacting with the internet in different ways
- Playing around with new stuff in my Homelab
- Anything Open Source (specially if I can contribute to it :D)
