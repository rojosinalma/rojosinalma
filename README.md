### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Fernando, but people also call me FeÃ±a or Rojo (rojo means red... cause I'm a ginger)

**Some stuff about me:**

- I also like coding!, mostly with Ruby and Python
- But Iâ€™m also learning Golang
- I'm also a gamer, live music enjoyer and bass player 

**Some projects I enjoy:**
- CLI tools, Bots, and other automations
- Backend applications or tools using Ruby and Python
