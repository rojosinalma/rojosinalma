### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Fernando, but people also call me FeÃ±a or Rojo.

**Some stuff about me:**
- I'm interested in Platform Engineering, Web Development, Security, SRE, Cloud Architecture, self-hosted infrastructure, and many other topics in the Tech world.
- I code mostly in Ruby and Python, but Iâ€™m also learning Golang.
- I'm also a live music enjoyer, Bass player, D&D DM/Player/Watcher and many other types of nerd.

**Some projects I enjoy:**
- AI assistants, CLI tools, Bots, System and other different types of automation
- Backend applications, APIs and interacting with the internet in different ways
- Playing around with self-hosted apps in my Homelab
- Anything Open Source (Specially if I can contribute :D)
